# unstableChat
The idea is to create a webchat, this webchat will not save any messages, basically a temporary chat that people can talk and then it i'll be discarded.

To use this app, you can clone on your repository and execute a simple php -S servername:port

Then, on application/config/config.php, change $config['base_url'] to your servername.

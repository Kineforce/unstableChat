# unstableChat
The idea is to create a webchat, similar to Whatsapp Web in his layout.

In the future, i'll implement more stuff, sending images, audios, profile picture and the most important thing, implement WebSockets to improve performance and to stop polling the server each second with AJAX.

I've used Codeigniter to help me with this task, but i think i need to use better his resources, like his own validation methods, in this case i built my own and let it as it was.

Feel free to use any part of this code, i'm only developing this to study purposes.
